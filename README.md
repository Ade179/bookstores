Project requirements
Initialise React app.
The building blocks of your app should be set as re-usable components. Create a directory for your components.
Add React Router and set two <Route>s and <Link>s for the app's navigation:
Books - the default view:
Should display the list of books (empty at this point but it should be ready for the data) with the Remove button (no funcionality yet).
Create a component called Book for displaying a single book (receive a title and an author as prop) and reuse it in a component that displays a list of books.
Should display a form for adding a book (no functionality yet).
Create a separate component for this form (with inputs for a title and an author [IMPORTANT in the design you can see an input for a category - please replace it with an author.]).
Categories:
Should display a button "Check status" only.
Styling is not required at this point.
